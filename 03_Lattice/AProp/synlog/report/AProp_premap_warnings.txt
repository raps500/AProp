@W: MT462 :"f:\02_elektronik\033_aprop\01_verilog\acog_id.v":58:3:66:9|Net cog0.idecode.un1_execute30 appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. 
@W: MT531 :"f:\02_elektronik\033_aprop\01_verilog\acog_id.v":51:2:51:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including cog0.idecode.execute.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"f:\02_elektronik\033_aprop\03_lattice\cog0_mem.v":72:10:72:23|Found inferred clock AProp|clk_in which controls 276 sequential elements including cog0.acog_mem.mem.cog0_mem_0_0_3. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
